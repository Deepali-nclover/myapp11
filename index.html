    <h1>Git is VCS</h1>

    <p>Centralized version control systems have a single server that contains
all the different versions of projects.
â€¢ Distributed version control systems, you save versions of your
projects locally, on different computers, and also on server, and each
copy of project is a full backup of all your data. So if something
happens with server, then you still have the full backup of entire
project locally. And also you don't need to have network connection
in order to save versions of your project
